# Shapes

On-device single-stroke shape recognition for Swift, Android, and JavaScript. Draw one stroke and Shapes turns it into a clean vector shape: a line, rectangle, triangle, ellipse, or star. Everything runs locally, so the stroke never leaves the device or browser.

A small classifier proposes a shape, a geometric fitter produces the clean parameters, and the stroke is accepted only if it clears that class's calibrated gate. The result snaps to nice axes, circles, squares, and 15° rotations.

```

## Features

- Runs fully on device or in the local runtime. The stroke never leaves the machine.
- Recognizes `line`, `rectangle`, `triangle`, `ellipse`, and `star`, and rejects scribbles.
- Fits clean vector geometry and snaps it to axes, circles, squares, and 15° rotations.
- One and the same recognition pipeline on every platform, so results match: Core ML on Apple, LiteRT on Android and Linux, LiteRT.js in the browser.
- Small model bundled by default (about 0.2 MB on Apple, ~1.3 MB LiteRT), with explicit-directory download/adopt still available; recognition is typically a few milliseconds.
- Apple bonus: one-line live snapping on a PencilKit canvas with an undo-safe preview.

## Swift

### Install

Requirements: iOS 16+, macOS 13+, tvOS 16+, watchOS 9+, visionOS 1+, and Swift 5.9+.

Add Shapes with Swift Package Manager:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Desert-Ant-Labs/shapes.git", from: "0.4.5")
```

Then add the `Shapes` product to your app target. Live PencilKit snapping is part of the `Shapes` product.

The Core ML model is bundled by default because Shapes is small. `ShapesCoreMLResources` remains available for explicit bundle construction and tests. SwiftPM consumers who prefer on-demand download or an explicit model directory can disable the default `BundledModel` trait:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Desert-Ant-Labs/shapes.git", from: "0.4.5", traits: [])
```

With the trait disabled, `Shapes()` downloads on demand and `Shapes(directory:)` loads from or downloads into your chosen directory.

### Usage

Create one `Shapes` and reuse it. Construction is cheap and non-blocking. The model loads on first use, or earlier if you call `download`.

```swift
import Shapes

let shapes = Shapes()
if let shape = try await shapes.recognize(points: strokePoints) {
    switch shape {
    case let .rectangle(corners): ...       // [Point]
    case let .ellipse(center, semiMajor, semiMinor, rotation): ...
    default: break
    }
}
```

`recognize` accepts `[Point]` or, on Apple platforms, `[CGPoint]` and PencilKit `PKStroke`. On Apple, `Shape.path` gives a renderable `CGPath`.

Choose where the model comes from:

```swift
let shapes = Shapes()                       // bundled model by default
let shapes = Shapes(directory: myModelDir)  // explicit model directory
let shapes = Shapes(bundle: myBundle)       // bundled model resources
```

Download ahead of time, for example from an onboarding screen:

```swift
let shapes = Shapes()
if !shapes.isDownloaded() {
    try await shapes.download { fraction in
        print("\(Int(fraction * 100))%")
    }
}
```

Bundle the model in an Apple app:

```swift
import Shapes
import ShapesCoreMLResources

let shapes = Shapes(bundle: ShapesCoreMLResourcesBundle.bundle)
```

Live PencilKit snapping (iOS/visionOS):

```swift
import Shapes

canvasView.enableShapeSnapping()   // pause while drawing to preview; lift to snap
// Offline/instant: enableShapeSnapping(using: Shapes(bundle: ShapesCoreMLResourcesBundle.bundle))
```

### Example

[SwiftUI example app](Examples/ShapesSwiftExample)

## Android

### Install

Requirements: Android API 31+. The AAR contains prebuilt arm64-v8a and x86_64 native libraries.

Shapes is published to Maven Central.

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation("ai.desertant:shapes:0.4.5")
}
```

`ai.desertant:shapes` bundles the small LiteRT model by default, so normal installs work offline. To disable bundling, exclude the transitive resources artifact:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("ai.desertant:shapes:0.4.5") {
        exclude(group = "ai.desertant", module = "shapes-tflite-resources")
    }
}
```

With that exclusion, `Shapes(context)` downloads on demand and caches the model. `Shapes(context, directory = modelDir)` loads from or downloads into your chosen directory.

### Usage

```kotlin
import ai.desertant.shapes.Point
import ai.desertant.shapes.Shapes

val shapes = Shapes(context)                 // bundled model by default
val shape = shapes.recognize(strokePoints)   // Shape? (null if rejected)
when (shape) {
    is Shapes.Rectangle -> shape.corners
    is Shapes.Ellipse -> shape.center
    else -> {}
}
shapes.close()
```

`recognize` and `download` are `suspend` functions. Use `use` to close the native handle automatically:

```kotlin
Shapes(context).use { shapes ->
    val shape = shapes.recognize(strokePoints)
}
```

Download before first use:

```kotlin
val shapes = Shapes(context)
if (!shapes.isDownloaded()) {
    shapes.download()
}
```

Use an explicit model directory or bundled resources:

```kotlin
val cached = Shapes(context)                         // managed cache
val explicit = Shapes(context, directory = modelDir) // explicit model directory
val offline = Shapes.bundled()                       // explicit bundled constructor
```

### Example

[Android example app](Examples/ShapesAndroidExample)

## JavaScript and TypeScript

### Install

The same import runs in the browser (WebAssembly + LiteRT.js) and server-side in Node (a prebuilt native core), selected automatically by conditional exports. Node needs no setup; browser builds add the LiteRT.js runtime.

```bash
# Browser builds:
npm i @desert-ant-labs/shapes @litertjs/core

# Node only:
npm i @desert-ant-labs/shapes
```

Server-side native builds ship for linux-x64, linux-arm64 (LiteRT), and darwin-arm64 (Core ML); other platforms fall back to a clear error, so use the Swift package or a browser there.

### Usage

```ts
import { Shapes } from "@desert-ant-labs/shapes";

const shapes = await Shapes.load();               // bundled model by default
const shape = await shapes.recognize(points);     // [{x, y}, ...] or [x0, y0, ...]
if (shape?.kind === "ellipse") shape.center;
```

Control loading:

```js
const shapes = await Shapes.load({
  directory: "/var/cache/shapes",       // Node only, optional
  onProgress: (fraction) => console.log(fraction),
});
```

Bring your own LiteRT.js module (browser), useful for bundlers and React Native:

```js
import * as litert from "@litertjs/core";
import { Shapes } from "@desert-ant-labs/shapes";

const shapes = await Shapes.load({ litert, litertWasmDir: "/path/to/@litertjs/core/wasm/" });
```

### Example

[JavaScript examples](Examples/ShapesWasmExample)

## Shapes

All platforms return the same shape, discriminated by kind, or `null` when the stroke is rejected or degenerate:

- `line(from, to)`
- `rectangle(corners)` - four points around the perimeter
- `triangle(vertices)` - three vertices
- `ellipse(center, semiMajor, semiMinor, rotation)` - `rotation` in radians
- `star(center, outerRadius, innerRadius, rotation, pointCount)`

The field names and shape kinds are identical across Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript. `minimumConfidence` (default `0`) raises the classifier threshold on top of each class's calibrated gate.

## Model and caching

The model artifacts are published at [`desert-ant-labs/shapes`](https://huggingface.co/desert-ant-labs/shapes) on Hugging Face. Each SDK pins the model revision to its own package version, and downloads are SHA-256 verified.

Default behavior:

- Swift: bundles the Core ML model by default, with explicit-directory download/adopt still available.
- Android: bundles the LiteRT model by default through the normal `ai.desertant:shapes` dependency.
- JavaScript: bundles the LiteRT model in the npm package by default.

Passing an explicit `directory` makes that directory the model home. Existing valid files are adopted for offline use; otherwise Shapes downloads into that directory and reuses it later.
